## In Progress
- Enhancing memory extraction for more accurate user preference identification
- Optimizing image storage to prevent hitting Firestore document size limits
- Adding image compression functionality
- Implementing additional loading states for improved user experience
- Working on chat history search functionality

## Up Next
- Improve memory visualization and management on the memory test page
- Add more comprehensive memory analysis algorithms
- Implement user profile management
- Add advanced history features (search, filtering, categorization)
- Create chat export functionality
- Implement message editing and deletion
- Add chat sharing capabilities

## Known Issues
- Memory extraction sometimes misses important information from large conversations
- Memory updates can be delayed in some edge cases
- Large images cause Firestore document size limits to be exceeded
- No image compression before storage causes unnecessarily large data usage
- Loading states missing in some parts of the application
- History pagination not yet implemented for large chat collections
