# Active Context

## Current Focus
UI implementation for landing page and authentication completed. Created marketing landing page and authentication UI (login, register, password reset). Next steps include implementing protected chat route and OpenAI integration.

## Recent Changes
- Set up Next.js 15 project with App Router
- Installed required dependencies (firebase, openai, zod, react-hook-form, shadcn/ui components)
- Created basic folder structure
- Added placeholder files for Firebase and OpenAI integration
- Implemented useAuth hook for Firebase authentication
- Created landing page with marketing content and signup/login buttons
- Implemented login, register, and password reset pages
- Created shared authentication layout

## Next Steps
1. Create protected chat route
2. Implement OpenAI integration for text responses
3. Add image upload functionality
4. Integrate GPT-4 Vision API for image analysis

## Active Decisions
- Component organization strategy (created layout components for auth pages)
- State management approach (using React hooks and context)
- Optimal UI design for chat interface
- Image upload and storage implementation

## Open Questions
- Should we implement rate limiting for API calls?
- How to handle large image files efficiently?
- How to optimize chat history storage?
- What specific system prompt will yield the best food-specific responses?
- How to implement robust error handling for API failures?

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring the AI assistant stays strictly within food-related topics
- Optimizing image upload and processing
- Creating a seamless authentication experience
- Ensuring responsive design works well on all devices
- Managing OpenAI API costs and rate limits

## Implementation Notes
- Next.js 15 App Router will be used for routing
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Firebase Storage for image uploads
- Chat interface will need optimistic UI updates
- OpenAI API calls should be server-side only
- System prompt critical for constraining responses to food topics
